/**
 * Asks a vision model whether the figure is doing what the video is doing.
 *
 * Server-side because the key has to be. Everything else about this project
 * runs in the browser and stays there, but an API key in client code is a key
 * anyone can read out of the bundle — so the frames go to this route, the route
 * holds the credential, and the browser never sees it.
 *
 * **This is the one part of the pipeline that uploads video.** The landing page
 * promises that no frame of video leaves the device, and for live recognition
 * and every other pass that stays true. This route breaks it by design, for the
 * baking step only, and only when someone presses the button. That is a product
 * decision, not a technical one, and it should be said plainly in the UI
 * wherever this is offered.
 *
 * ## Two providers
 *
 * **DeepSeek** is the default, because it is roughly thirty times cheaper for
 * this job and this job is thousands of nearly-identical calls. Its vision
 * model caps every image at 384 tokens however large it arrives, which is what
 * makes a four-image request cost a fraction of a cent.
 *
 * **Claude** is kept for when a frame is genuinely hard and the judgement is
 * worth more than the fee.
 *
 * The difference that matters below is not the URL — DeepSeek speaks the OpenAI
 * wire format, so the request shape is standard — it is that DeepSeek's JSON
 * mode guarantees the reply *parses* and not that it matches the schema. Hence
 * the worked example in the prompt and `parseCritique` on the way back, neither
 * of which the Claude path needs.

const SYSTEM = `You are checking a 3D figure against a frame of dance video.

You will be given, in order:
  1. one frame from the video of a real dancer
  2. renders of a 3D figure that is supposed to be reproducing that exact frame,
     seen from several angles

Judge only the POSE. Ignore appearance entirely: the figure has no clothing,
no face and no hair, and is a different build from the dancer. A featureless
figure in the correct pose is a match.

Work through the body in this order and stop at what is actually wrong:
torso lean and twist, then each arm's hand position, then each hand's fingers,
then the head. The dance is Bharatanatyam, so the hands carry most of the
meaning — a hand shape that is close but not the same gesture is a real error,
where a slightly different elbow height usually is not.

Reply with json only, in exactly this shape:

${CRITIQUE_EXAMPLE}

  - "part" must be one of: ${PARTS.join(", ")}
  - "issue" must be one of: ${ISSUES.join(", ")}
  - "severity" must be one of: ${SEVERITIES.join(", ")}
  - Return at most three fixes. If more than three things are wrong, report the
    three that matter most.
  - Say "matches": true when the pose is right, even if it is not perfect, and
    return an empty "fixes" array. Small differences are expected.
  - "confidence" is your confidence in the fixes, not in the match. Below 0.6
    the fixes are discarded, so use a low number when the angles do not let you
    tell.
  - Directions are the DANCER'S left and right, not the viewer's.
  - "notes" is read by a person. One sentence, plain language.`;
